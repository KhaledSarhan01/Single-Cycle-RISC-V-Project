 my understanding:
    it's 32-bit word x 32 bit address memory which store program instructions 
 
 book Description:
    The instruction memory has a single read port.It takes a 32-bit 
    instruction address input, A, and reads the 32-bit data (i.e., instruction) 
    from that address onto the read data output, RD.
